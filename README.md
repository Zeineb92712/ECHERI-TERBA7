## 🌍 Project Vision

Finding the right clothes online is often difficult because:
- There are too many choices
- Recommendations are not personalized
- Budget, distance, and availability are ignored
- Search is based only on keywords

Echeri Terba7 aims to solve this by:
- Understanding user preferences (style, budget, lifestyle)
- Understanding product meaning (color, material, season, usage)
- Matching users with the most relevant products
- Reducing shipping cost by prioritizing nearby stores
- Adapting recommendations to weather and season
